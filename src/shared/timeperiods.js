      "The Wild West consisted of American settlers searching for new opportunities on the American frontier. This westward expansion past the original 13 colonies started after the revolutionary war was won in 1783. It continued westward until 1912 when the final western territories were officially made into states. There is so much history in that time period that I could never hope to thoroughly go over it all in just a few paragraphs. So I will just go over very briefly some general information about the American West.",
